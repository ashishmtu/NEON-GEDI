# Biomass Data Processing and Feature Extraction

This repository contains several Python notebooks for processing and extracting features from biomass and satellite data, such as PFT (Plant Functional Types), GEDI simulated waveforms, and more. Each script handles specific tasks such as clipping, normalization, and feature extraction from NEON and GEDI datasets.
