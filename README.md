# Aboveground Biomass Density (AGBD) Data Processing and Feature Extraction

This repository contains several Python notebooks that were used for processing and extracting data for developing and training Deep learning models to estimate AGBD, such as PFT (Plant Functional Types), GEDI simulated waveforms, and more. Each script handles specific tasks such as clipping, normalization, and feature extraction from NEON and simulated GEDI datasets.

## Table of Contents

| File Name | Type | Description | Important Parameters | Input | Output |
|-----------|------|-------------|----------------------|-------|--------|
| [Clip-DTM-NEON.ipynb](./Clip-DTM-NEON.ipynb) | Jupyter Notebook | Clips NEON DTM (Digital Terrain Model) data to a specified boundary or extent for normalizing NEON Discrete return LiDAR point cloud. | - `input_dtm`: Path to the NEON DTM data.<br> - `clip_extent`: Bounding box or shapefile for clipping.<br> - `output_clipped_dtm`: Path to save the clipped DTM. | NEON DTM raster files. | Clipped DTM data based on the specified boundary. |
