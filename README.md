# Aboveground Biomass Density Estimation Using Deep Learning: Insight from NEON Ground-Truth Data and Simulated GEDI Waveform
## Abstract
Accurate estimation of forest Aboveground Biomass Density (AGBD) is essential for understanding and managing Earth's carbon cycle and informing climate change mitigation strategies. NASA's Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) mission has advanced global forest structure mapping; however, its AGBD estimates exhibit significant variability across forest types and regions due to limitations in model transferability and training data. This study aims to enhance AGBD estimation by leveraging deep learning techniques to model complex, non-linear relationships in ecological data, using extensive ground-truth data from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) and simulated GEDI waveforms. We developed and compared various deep learning models, including one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D CNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs), against traditional linear regression and random forest models. Using data from 2,948 NEON plots across diverse ecological settings in the United States, with AGBD calculated from NEON's Vegetation Structure data, and simulated GEDI waveforms generated from NEON's LiDAR point clouds, we found that deep learning models, particularly pre-trained CNNs, significantly outperformed traditional methods. The ResNet152 model achieved an RÂ² of 0.68 for live biomass estimation, compared to 0.58 for linear regression, demonstrating up to 17% improvement. However, deep learning model performance declined with reduced dataset sizes, emphasizing the need for large, diverse training data. Stratification by plant functional types revealed that different models were more effective for specific vegetation categories, underscoring the importance of tailoring model selection to distinct forest ecosystems. Our findings indicate that deep learning models offer significant potential for improving AGBD estimation accuracy, contributing to more precise assessments of forest carbon stocks and enhancing the effectiveness of climate change mitigation efforts.
